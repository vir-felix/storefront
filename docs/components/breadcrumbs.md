# Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs can be either a location or heiarchial based navigation trail to help users see how they navigated to a specific page.

This startkit uses breadcrumbs in two locations:
1. On any `Tag` grid page, we use a heiarchial system to show where the current tag lives
1. On any Product Detail Page (PDP), we use [MobX](docs/MOBX.md) to create a navigation based system, to show how the user has landed on this PDP.
